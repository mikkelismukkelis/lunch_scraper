#Lunch Scraper

Skeleton for scraping lunch lists for collegues.

Final version includes sending lists via email and maybe some site to show gathered lists.

Reason for this "project" was real: we were hungry and eating place finding is hard thing to do! :D

At same time learning web scraping with cheerio and puppeteer.
